                        Hello - my is Jason - welcome to the first iteration of my personal Web Development Portfolio! I tinkered off-and-on with HTML and CSS during my high school years, entered college at UT-Austin as a Computer Science major, then changed paths and graduated with a B.S. in Architectural Engineering. After graduation, I moved to Dallas, working as an E.I.T. at a Structural Engineering firm. In the wake of the '08-'09 economic downturn, I transitioned to a Sales career with various DFW based companies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sales proved fruitful in the beginning, but forward movement has become stagnant. With a rapidly developing technology market, I firmly believe it is time to transition careers once again. Change is tough, but with 20 / 20 hindsight, I know I'm making the right decision to circle back to my younger days of coding. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By enrolling in SMU's Coding Bootcamp - I'm now taking the proper steps to position myself in the technology market. My current objective is to build a firm foundation in full-stack web development, front-to-back end. Then, leveraging skills learned in this course and at home, I hope to land a new position with a DFW based company with a major web presence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The current version of my Portfolio site is basic at its core, especially as I re-hone my HTML and CSS skills. However as the course progresses, I will continually update the site to showcase newly learned skills. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Stay tuned for updates!
                    </p>
